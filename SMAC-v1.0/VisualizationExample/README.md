This folder contains input files that we use as examples for importing into genome browser. 
These include the reference genome file in FASTA format, an example.bw file representing penetrance at the composite level, and an example.bam file with single-base resolution 6mA information generated by the 6mAviewer.pl script and samtools at the single-molecule level. Users can load the reference genome file into their local genome browser (such as IGV, https://igv.org) via `Genomes > Load Genome from File`, while other track files can be loaded via `File > Load from File`. It is recommended to adjust the height of the penetrance track to a range of 0-1. 6mA on the Watson and Crick strands are marked in yellow and blue, respectively.
